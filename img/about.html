        <p>I'm Timothy Nguyen, an aspiring UX and UI designer from Sydney. I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Design Computing. I fell in love with user experience as I grew fond of finding new solutions to improve the lives of others, primarily through design. I want to always aim to design innovative products and create better experiences for others.</p>
        <p class="second-p">I chose to study Design Computing because technology has always played a large role in my life and being able to see it constantly innovated and developed, sparked an interest in wanting to create new products.  Studying Design Computing allowed me to gain insight in understanding problems and reframing it to uncover potential solutions. Design Computing provided different perspectives for situations and taught me to always keep trying to find new but suitable answers.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I love The Office (US version of course). Dwight is my favourite fictional character of all time because I think his weirdness and humour relates to me. </li>
            <li>I have an unusual skill of being able to memorise routes to locations after driving to it once or twice. It’s pretty useful when playing games like Minecraft.</li>
            <li>I’ve been interested in sneakers since I was 12. I started reselling sneakers when I was 16 and still do it today. It’s my side hobby as I love connecting with others in the community.</li>
            <li>The Star Wars and Marvel/DC Universe are some of my favourite things to follow. I love reading the comics and watching the content on it.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy watching Netflix documentaries ESPECIALLY crime and the supernatural.</li>
        </ul>
