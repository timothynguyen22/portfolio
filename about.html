                    <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                    <p>Hi there again! I'd love for you to get a glimpse of who I am. I'm passionate about crafting meaningful user experiences through innovative design solutions. I hold a Bachelor of Design-Computing from the University of Sydney, and I'm currently leveraging my skills as an Associate Consultant at frog, a renowned design and innovation consultancy within Capgemini Invent. I have previous experience working as a web designer at Cinemano Media where I consulted with small businesses and clients about their Shopify and Wordpress websites. My role entailed me to improve the user experience of their website, create designs for websites, and improve SEO, foot traffic and conversion.</p>
                    <p class="section_paragraph">ðŸŽ¨ Designing is my language:</p>
                    <p>With a solid foundation in UX/UI design, I specialise in creating impactful wireframes that bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality. My knack for understanding user needs allows me to consult with clients effectively, translating their visions into user-centric solutions. Through thorough user research and analysis, I identify pain points and opportunities, enabling me to architect seamless and intuitive experiences.</p>
                    <p class="section_paragraph">ðŸš€ Constant growth, constant impact:</p>
                    <p>My dedication to continuous improvement is not just professionalâ€”it's personal. I'm committed to refining my craft and staying ahead of industry trends, ensuring that my designs are always at the forefront of innovation. Beyond design, I'm passionate about embarking on a journey of self-improvement through reading, expanding my horizons of personal development. You'll often find me in the gym, channeling my enthusiasm for physical improvement as a parallel pursuit to my professional aspirations.</p>
