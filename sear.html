                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>Sear is a Korean barbeque service where the experience of eating Korean barbeque can be enjoyed at the comfort of the customers' home. Originating in 2021 during a period of lockdown, Sear delivers high-quality restaurant dishes coupled with a distinctive home-dining atmosphere. Seeking to enhance their online presence, Sear sought help in revamping their website to enhance conversions and ensure a smooth digital customer journey.</p>
                <p class="section_paragraph">Upon understanding the client's objectives, we pinpointed the challenges within the customer journey. Subsequently, we devised a tailored solution to address these pain points and align with the client's goals.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>We conducted a website analysis of Sear's website and some of the findings we found include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A complex sitemap that resulted in an unclear user journey.</li>
                    <li>A cognitive overload of information that would not allow users to not navigate properly.</li>
                    <li>Atmosphere of website resembled an ecommerce website that showcased products over offering a service.</li>
                    <li>Backend of website could be adjusted to reduce unnecessary costs.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="solution">
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>To address the issues and achieve Sear's goals, we redesigned the entire website to provide a better user experience. The new changes included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We created new graphics to showcase the home KBBQ experience and the great foods offered.</li>
                    <li>Removed any unnecessary sections and pages that would cause users to get lost navigating.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a consistent brand guide to make the website have better readability and usability.</li>
                    <li>Uninstalled plugins that could be substitued with alternatives to automate tasks.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a <i>Build Your Own Banquet</i> custom function for users to create their own experience.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>The redesign of the Sear website received positive feedback from the client and their customers. The updated graphics enriched the website's theme and drew in more visitors, leading to a 48% surge in traffic.
