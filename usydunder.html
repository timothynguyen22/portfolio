        <h2 class="second-h2">Brief: Understanding Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change causes new weather patterns due to changes in the Earth’s climate system (Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). This has led to unprecedented global disasters that are predicted to worsen unless immediate action is taken to reduce man made emissions (NASA, 2020). Despite this, there is a portion of the world’s population who are skeptical of climate change (Maslin 2020) and others who are not aware of what they can do to help tackle the issue. To tackle this issue, developers have started utilising virtual reality (VR) to help change perceptions around climate change and help people understand its effects. VR is now more accessible than ever before (Yoo & Parker, 2015) and is an ideal tool for raising awareness and helping increase understanding as it enables users to be fully immersed in its virtual environments, allowing for issues to be experienced firsthand. We are asked to further explore the potential of VR around the topic of climate change.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The growing impact of climate change on society has been more evident in the past decade. Rising sea levels are predicted over the next few decades as a product of climate change. Cities will be flooded and, possibly be completely submerged by water. From various research methods, individuals were aware of climate change but did not fully grasp the potential dangers.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Solution</h2>
        <p>The solution is to educate people. In order to that, a VR application concept is introduced where the user is placed in a city environment that is gradually being flooded by water. It showcases the effects of climate change whilst motivates the user to reduce the effects through a gamification approach. To provide an immersive experience, USYD Underwater is created.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h2>Illustrate the effects of climate change</h2>
        <p>We wanted to depict a simulation that allowed the user to be immerse in an enviroment they were familiar with.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Create a joyful experience</h2>
        <p>We wanted to take a gamified approach to educate the audience to not only make it fun but informative..</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Learn 3D modelling and interaction coding</h2>
        <p>I had a personal goal of learning how to create an environment and the user's interactions with it to construct an immersive experience.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>From shifting weather patterns to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be increasingly more costly and difficult. Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver (AAS, 2009).</p>
        <p class="second-p">Due to the build-up of greenhouse gases as a result of the burning of fossil fuels, the Earth’s atmosphere is progressively warming from the trapped heat. Consequently, the increase in temperature is causing the rapid melting of glaciers. According to WWF, even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the world's remaining glaciers will melt by the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone. Scientists project that if emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice free in the summer of 2040 as ocean and air temperatures continue to rise.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Melting glaciers add to the rise in sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and elevates storm surge as air and ocean temperature warm, creating more frequent and intense coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons. Coastal communities will continue to face billion-dollar disaster recovery bills as flooding becomes more frequent and storms become more intense. People are not the only ones impacted. In the Arctic, as glaciers melt, wildlife such as polar bears and walrus lose their habitats.</p>
        <p class="second-p">The utilisation of virtual reality creates new opportunities to raise awareness for climate change impacts by tackling the biggest challenges of climate change communication. Because greenhouse gas emissions today will affect the climate long into the future, the temporal scale of climate change can be difficult for the public to comprehend. Witmer and Singer (1998) describe immersive virtual environments as those that perceptually surround an individual. In essence, virtual reality as a medium is capable of transporting individuals into a reality where long-term environmental changes can be experienced firsthand. By immersing people in the evident reality of a warmer world yet to come, may accelerate climate action.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Our team aims to create an immersive environment for the user to experience firsthand about the influence of climate change on our oceans sea level as a result from the melting glaciers. Furthermore, we intend to raise awareness while educating users on possible solutions to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through meaningful interactions.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h2>Psychological Barrier between People & Climate Change</h2>
        <p>The more we know how people are feeling, thinking and doing in relation to climate change, then the more we are able to help them respond in meaningful ways that both reduce the threats of climate change as well as prepare people to adapt to the consequences that cannot be avoided.</p>
        <p class="second-p">A major issue as to why people tend to not act towards climate change is that people like to live in the moment, preferring to satisfy their immediate needs rather than considering what may serve them best for the future. According to Bisin & Hyndman (2014), this is commonly known as ‘present bias’, where we people are more inclined to put greater weight on payoffs that are closer to the present moment compared to those in the future.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Another reason that we don’t prioritise climate action comes down to the lack of salience associated with the effects of climate change. Salience refers to how noticeable and memorable certain stimuli are to us. This is why certain environmental campaigns have been more successful in making an impact than others. Although we are aware of the issue, people do not seem to perceive the risks of climate change as vivid, relevant or alarming.</p>
        <p class="second-p">This can be explained by perceptions of psychological distancing. According to construal level theory, when people, places, objects or events are removed from an individual’s immediate experience, their mental representations become less concrete and more abstract. As a result, most people are not forced to grapple with specifics of climate change but rather treat it as an abstract concept.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Based on the ‘psychological barriers’ identified, if we can make our climate solution seem more tangible, urgent and salient in the minds of individuals, then they might be more motivated to change their current behaviour and make a conscious effort to help reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Why VR?</h2>
        <p>The use of virtual reality aids us in overcoming these ‘psychological barriers’ by blurring the distinction between reality and its virtual representation which sets it apart from traditional forms of media. As previously mentioned, people don't have a concrete understanding of what climate change is and what the tangible impacts of it may be. Virtual reality has the unique ability to address these issues by fully immersing the user in a virtual environment where they feel as though climate change is happening in the future. As a result, the immediacy of events has the potential to resonate on a deeper emotional level.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>Look Ahead San Francisco (Hills-Duty, 2017) is a campaign between the City and County of San Francisco which highlights the impacts of melting polar ice caps on the city’s most iconic locations. The 360° virtual reality app portrays the city in 3 different environments; the current water level and the future where climate action has and has not been taken. The app also provides information on how to reduce flooding risk, cutting carbon emissions and switching to renewable energy supplies. The launch of the climate campaign and virtual reality app provides a new way for San Francisco to raise awareness about the future sea level rise while involving community members in efforts to increase resilience and meet climate action.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Singapore Underwater (Singapore underwater) is a virtual reality simulation that delves into the global projection of rising sea levels. It places you at the base of the Merlion statue overlooking Marina Bay and compares the current water level of Singapore contrasted to Singapore in the year 2500 where the water level has risen by 6 meters based on scientific projection. Not only does it depict the enormous impact of climate change on Singapore but also educates the user on how Singapore might try to mitigate against rising seas and the possible impact of land loss and saltwater contamination of the country's farmland and reservoirs.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Sea Level Rise Explorer (Virtual Planet Technologies LLC) is a virtual reality simulation that allows us to experience the familiar coastlines of Santa Cruz being inundated by rising sea levels and storm surge. It depicts 3 locations in Santa Cruz and for each location the user can experience the sea level in 2018, during a king tide and a projection of 2.4 feet of sea level rise in combination to a 100-year storm. By using the application, users are able to visualise complex coastal issues in a fully immersive and interactive environment.</p>
        <p class="second-p">Each existing solution successfully creates an immersive experience for the user while highlighting the detrimental effects of climate change on the polar ice caps and in turn rising sea levels. Although Look ahead San Francisco and Singapore Underwater successfully convey the impact well but fail to capitalise on the utilisation of VR application, like aspects of interactivity and gamification.</p>

      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <h2>VR App Design Concept</h2>
      <p>Our VR app concept places the viewer in a virtual environment where they are able to freely interact and explore the environment. The VR environment will include a city that is gradually being flooded by water to create an immersive experience. It showcases the effect of climate change of melting glaciers and rising sea levels on a modern city. The VR app concept depicts the actions and consequences of the user to educate them on the effects of climate change. These interactions will inform users methods in which they are able to reduce the effects of climate change.</p>
      <h2 class="second-h2">Experiential Aspects</h2>
      <p>The main aspect of the VR concept incorporates the effect of flooding, as a result from rising sea levels, on a city that will gradually be immersed by the water. Gamification aspects are incorporated into the environment which encourages the user to slow down the process of climate change. An aspect that will be implemented was a bar on the user’s screen that displays the climate change process. This bar would play a role on giving feedback to the user to help assist them in maintaining the levels of impact of climate change on the city. The rising sea levels would be based on the user’s interactions with the environment. The user would be able to interact with objects that have an increasing influence on climate change such as reducing waste via recycling, switching their cars to electric motors or switching to renewable energy. Other experimental aspects to this project include the adaptation of the assets in the world around the user, from buildings to cars, boats and even submarines.</p>
      <h2 class="second-h2">Target User Groups</h2>
      <p>The target user group that the VR app concept is aimed at people in the 20-40 year age group. We have selected this target user group for our VR app concept as they have the biggest influence in mitigating climate change issues as well as having the opportunity to educate the future generation on reduce carbon emissions.</p>
      <p class="second-p">Lee, Gjersoe, O’Neill, and Barnett (2020) state there is a difference of understanding of climate change between age groups as “scientifically correct knowledge about causes... to climate change generally increases with age.”. Chiw and Ling (2018) found that 70% of the 102 participants that they surveyed found that “people do not or will not take their opinions on climate change seriously,” which illustrates the lack of understanding of the consequences of our actions. Various campaigns and laws encourage climate change awareness, however further statistics reveal that 77% of the participants would like to see schools teach more about climate change. Markman, A. (2018) states that “ignoring climate change in the short term has benefits to individuals” as they do not have to alter their lifestyle such as making changes to the cars they drive or the products they buy. Many individuals believe that the short-term problems outweigh long-term issues as there is no motivation or incentive to encourage them to implement changes into their lives.</p>
      <p class="second-p">The design goals of the VR app concept addresses both the impact of climate change and educating the user on reducing the effect of climate change. As the VR environment showcases the city underwater, the gamified aspect of the environment acts as an incentive for the user to maintain the effects of climate change. It would address the motivation issue that individuals lack by depicting the effects of the decisions that users undertake in their virtual life in the environment. The VR environment focuses on educating the user by illustrating the influence they control on the environment and using the ‘climate change bar’ as a feedback indicator and incentive in maintaining the environment. Previous design solutions aimed to display a future climate change has heavily affected the world in a negative manner without educating the user on how to prevent that future. Our VR app concept tackles the issue by educating the user on mitigating the effects of climate change as well as portraying the consequences on certain actions.</p>

      <h2 class="second-h2">Interviews</h2>
      <p>From the first batch of interviews, we found that many people were aware of the impact of climate change on the planet and the dangers it possesses in the present and future. Wirdjinata, E. (2020) stated in an interview that he believes that in the future, there will be higher sea levels and some cities, such as Venice, will be completely submerged underwater. Mendoza, I. (2020) also stated in the interview that climate change would completely change the way society functioned where cities would be entirely submerged underwater and boats and submarines were the primary modes of transport.</p>
      <p class="second-p">The interviews about climate change played a role in the initial idea of our VR app concept. The idea involved the simulation of a city that is gradually submerged underwater due to the effects of climate change.</p>
      <h2 class="second-h2">Iterations</h2>
      <p>Our first set of design iterations began with our sketches of our proposed establishing city view, which we incorporated into our first storyboard. To begin, we wanted to test if this idea would prove to be a valid use for VR, in accordance with our underwater city concept. We tackled this initially by putting the user in the shoes of a tourist on a boat, viewing the conceptual changes that occur to a city over time, as the sea levels rise.</p>
      <p class="second-p">From our first set of testing, we came to realise several key points raised that we needed to iterate on.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>It needed to be more immersive - While the ‘outside-in’ view we proposed in the storyboard communicated the concept, users consistently asked if they could move around, or be within the city, seeing the water engulf them. Additionally, our ‘outside-in’ view gave users a confusing interpretation of scale. This led to discussion about the underwater city concept like an AR tabletop game.</li>
          <li>It needed more interactivity and moving objects - While our users enjoyed the idea of this VR ‘demo’, it was clear that the storyboard only communicated a static viewing position.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="second-p">In our second iteration, we began with storyboards that put the user at ground zero, surrounded by 1:1 scale buildings, streets and objects. We also wanted to better communicate how movement played a role, especially when people start to run from certain areas, to increase immersiveness and a sense of danger. Continuing our testing, we found that this concept better communicated the immersive potential of an underwater city in VR. Additionally, the idea of lights turning off as the water rose added to an associated impact of rising sea levels.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The streets might be empty with just people and the same buildings - To further increase immersiveness, we realised that placing the user in the middle of a street seemed a bit out of the ordinary, in addition to certain assets, like cars, on the street.</li>
        <li>Moving objects are great but need more interactivity - While the idea of floating objects, like signs, add more potential to interacting with the surrounding environment, the scene needs more aspects of interactivity that change certain aspects of the scene; perhaps actions that could slow or speed up the rate of rising sea levels?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="second-h2">Summary of Findings</h2>
    <p>In summary, sea levels are predicted to continue to rise over the next few decades as a product of climate change, and this will cause major shifts in how society will and should adapt. Additionally, we can also identify that there is a psychological barrier that exists between people and climate change. This barrier has led to a significant percentage of the world’s population who prefer to live in the moment, satisfying immediate needs above planning for a better future; akin to present bias. The use of virtual reality and its potential applications blurs the distinction between reality and a virtual world; one that we can use in a highly effective manner to build and bridge this psychological gap.</p>
    <p class="second-p">This utilisation of VR currently exists in the market, but we’ve identified that while they exist as fantastic VR applications that communicate the impact of rising sea levels well, they fail to capitalise on the full utilisation of VR that separates this technology from 360° video. Namely, these aspects of VR are direct interactivity and gamification; two aspects that are heavily influential in shifting human perception and empathy.</p>
    <p class="second-p">Our underwater city VR application aims to bridge this psychological gap and help make individuals more aware of the effects of climate change and rising sea levels; in addition to the potential dangers and adaptations society may have to make in order to overcome them.</p>

        <h2>Development: USYD Underwater</h2>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>Users will need to have a smartphone device or computer which is able to access the internet. They will also need to have access to the WebVR link which will take them to the VR prototype when clicked. If users are viewing the prototype from their computer, they can move around using the ‘WASD’ or arrows keys and their mouse to look around . If they are viewing it from their phone, they can do the same by scrolling their finger across the screen. If the user wishes to view the environment in VR, they will need to use a VR headset such as a Google Cardboard and tap the ‘VR’ icon to switch modes.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">External Assets</h2>
        <h2>Sounds</h2>
        <p>We used a simple city soundtrack to be played in an audio loop when the user enters the environment. This enhances the immersion of the scene.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Plugins</h2>
        <p>We used the Blender-osm plugin (Prochitecture, 2020) which allowed us to import geographical data from OpenStreetMap into our Blender scene. From this, we were able to know the rough estimate of buildings shapes and their relative position in the environment as well as the size of roads and pathways. In accompaniment with the Blender-osm plugin, we also used the building tool plugin for blender. Using the outline of building shapes from Blender-osm, we used the Building Tools plugin (Ranjian & Luckykadam, 2020) which enabled us to create floors and easily generate windows and doors. This allowed us to focus more on the details of the building and make the Eastern Avenue environment more recognisable.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Unity - Standard Assets</h2>
        <p>We used the water asset from the Unity Standard Assets for the environment where it would rise and fall based on conditions.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Known Issues</h2>
        <h2>Building Textures</h2>
        <p>Due to the building tool plugin for Blender being in alpha development, textures didn’t apply to buildings while in Unity. As a result, we applied simple materials to the buildings instead. Furthermore, when applying a transparent material like glass to the surface of a building, the walls on the interior of the building disappeared when viewing it from head on.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Gravity</h2>
        <p>We used the FBX Controller in Unity to allow the user to walk around the environment, however, we came across an issue which prevented gravity from applying to the scene. As a result we had to disable it so the user now freely controls the camera, which may look like they’re flying.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Flickering Boats</h2>
        <p>A boat script had to be incorporated with the rising water script to create a realistic atmosphere and feel of the objects. As the water rose, the boats rose. However when the boats reached the max water limit, it flicked to a different position. It only flicked the x and z positions when the boats reached the max water limit but the x and z positions remained static when rising and falling.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Mesh Colliders</h2>
        <p>A boat script had to be incorporated with the rising water script to create a realistic atmosphere and feel of the objects. As the water rose, the boats rose. However when the boats reached the max water limit, it flicked to a different position. It only flicked the x and z positions when the boats reached the max water limit but the x and z positions remained static when rising and falling.</p>
        <h2 class="second-h2">Future Works</h2>
        <p>There were many ideas that were planned to be implemented but, due to time constraints, only the main functions were implemented into the virtual reality environment. Some future considerations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Underwater Effects - An underwater post-process effect was applied to the environment but there were many issues involving the timing of the effect and sudden disability as it was further iterated. It would be a future consideration to implement properly as it would provide a more immersive experience for the user. The earlier use of the post-process utilised a fog and blue saturation that was triggered by a mesh collider but as iterations occurred along the way, the underwater effects no longer worked.</li>
            <li>Human Animation - The human objects all walk at the same pace and same direction due to them being a part of a parent game object. The decision to be a part of a parent game object stemmed from time constraints as individually scripting each human would be time consuming. There were another two animations that were created for the humans which were their idle and running state. These two animations would have been triggered by certain conditions but, as mentioned before, time constraints forced us into using only the walk animation. Utilising all the animations for the humans would be ideal for the future to create a more interactive environment for the user.</li>
            <li>Skybox - A skybox atmosphere could be added to the environment to create a wider scene for the user.</li>
            <li>Buttons - For future works, the UI buttons could be translated onto the game objects to incentivise the user to explore the environment. For example, the change car button would be placed onto each individual car and the change bike button would be placed onto each individual bike. This would create more conditions for the water to rise and fall.</li>
            <li>Extra Factors - In the later iterations of the VR environment, there was a third function implemented which allowed the user to grow trees to reduce the water rising. Multiple attempts were taken to create this function, however due to time constraints, the final iteration idea could not be created properly and was removed. Other suggestions towards factors included installation of solar panels around USYD and recycling around the environment. These factors would be a future work as it would provide more gamification to the environment to educate the user in climate change impact.</li>
