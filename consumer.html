                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>One of the largest global consumer goods companies wanted to bolster their internal system by integrating new functionalities. These additions focused on elevating user experience. The existing interface fell short in offering certain features essential for users to efficiently handle and obtain inventory. Some of the challenges that clients encountered included bulk uploading and modifying their inventory, as well as effectively tracking product shipments. The objective of the project was to revamp their internal system to provide users with the ability to bulk upload and edit their inventory, while also enhancing the clarity and accessibility of their delivery tracking.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I designed a stakeholder workshop on Miro and collaborated alongside the business analyst to delve into the core issues associated with the current state of the internal system and its interface. The aprimary objective of the workshop was to identify key pain points and gain insights that would aid in shaping the wireframe user interfaces for the forthcoming enhancements. Following the workshop, I created distinct wireframes tailored to each proposed implementation (bulk upload, bulk edit, and delivery tracking). Each wireframe aligned with user stories written by the business analyst. These wireframes were subsequently presented to project managers, the product owner, and stakeholders to solicit their input. Iterating on this, I engaged in two additional feedback sessions with the stakeholders before arriving at the final, confirmed wireframes.</p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>The enhancements to the internal system are currently in development. Notably, the suggested changes to the user interface have received enthusiastic feedback from the product owner and stakeholders. The anticipated launch of the revamped internal system is scheduled for December 2023.</p>
