                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>A government body approached Capgemini to redesign one of their informative pages to adhere to government laws. The body recognised the user experience and user interface design of their pages could be improved to be more accessible, user-friendly, and engaging for their users. The current interface of the specific page was found to be challenging to navigate, find information and understand the data presented. To address this, statutory body partnered with Capgemini on a project aimed at improving the user interface and experience of their webpages.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>To ensure the user interface aligned with stakeholders' needs and met client expectations, we conducted a series of five user tests on our redesigned wireframes. The objective of these tests was to validate the enhancements in our new designs and uncover valuable insights. I was involved in four of these user tests and had the opportunity to independently facilitate one.</p> 
                <p class="section_paragraph">In preparation for the user testing, I collaborated with another UX/UI designer to develop high-fidelity wireframes featuring functional prototypes that closely mimicked the website's actual appearance with our additional changes. After each session, we carefully documented design enhancements, considerations, and additional insights.</p>
                <p class="section_paragraph">The user testing process followed a structured approach: we began with a prototype walkthrough, proceeded to a field importance sorting activity, and concluded with an experience comparison exercise. Through this process, we identified six key design improvements, noted five design considerations for future iterations, and gained three additional insights.</p>
                <h5 class="section_paragraph">Insights</h5>
                <p>For design improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We conducted A/B testing to present two data display options: a card view and a table view. Interestingly, the table view emerged as the unanimous preference among all participants.</li>
                    <li>Users expressed a desire for enhanced search capabilities, seeking greater flexibility for searching for specific information.</li>
                    <li>Another A/B test was carried out centering around a modal presentation for data, with two options including a pop-up and a dropdown. 80% of participants favoured the modal pop-up, citing its ability to streamline their focus on relevant information.</li>
                    <li>There were challenges that arose in presenting multiple data elements, with certain naming conventions causing participant confusion.</li>
                    <li>Navigation issues were identified within the current website's navigation.</li>
                    <li>Valuable user insights guided the reordering of information fields based on the field importance sorting activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="section_paragraph">For design considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ability to download the information in different formats to allow users to verify the data against their own.</li>
                    <li>For additional information, most participants usually gained access from other websites.</li>
                    <li>Desktop was the preferred method to access the pages, but mobile provided value in certain situations.</li>
                    <li>Pre-defined search options potentially enhanced the search further if contextualised.</li>
                    <li>For other informative pages, users wanted to segragate specific information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="section_paragraph">Additional Insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users relied heavily on the website to verify and monitor information.</li>
                    <li>Viewing past information was not valuable for some users while others found it somewhat interesting.</li>
                    <li>The sub-menu on the current website had a significant negative impact on a user's experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="section_paragraph">These insights guided us in refining the wireframe user interfaces, which we subsequently presented to the product owner. To ensure thorough refinement, we engaged in three separate feedback sessions before ultimately confirming the final version of the wireframes.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>Following the approval of the wireframe user interface, the pages proceeded to the development phase. The product owner expressed contentment with the changes made to the web pages, and stakeholders reported that the updated interface was notably more user-friendly and efficient in terms of navigation and information retrieval based on a showcase of updated designs. The planned release of the new webpages is slated for the upcoming year.</p>
